To use this tool

open the bat file in a text editor

set the var gamelocation to the location you want  e.g D:\R5R


![config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661955-c50df7e3-b59f-4454-84ae-bbaa94f9879f.PNG)


create a folder in that location called game_files

![game_files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661642-04ac3735-43e4-47e6-a842-f849e7291382.png)


in that folder create three folders, core_game detours and scripts


![core_files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661672-0232e7eb-0621-4b24-b264-aa6f59231061.PNG)

in core_game you should place the files downloaded by the torrent

![game_dl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661725-01598691-3a09-419a-9ab3-a6b7ae81d2bc.PNG)

in scripts you should install the latest version of the scripts

![scripts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661747-365307a9-d84c-446d-87a0-aeabaf9eb5be.PNG)

and finally in detours, copy the files from the 1.6beta folder

![detours](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98644082/152661788-9962f5ea-060d-4df5-96f9-0625124a0703.PNG)

after that run the bat file as ADMIN (needed for mklink to work correctly)
and follow the instructions
